# uri_graph
## Mea culpa

I tried to isolate each exercise's code on it's own folder, so it can be just copied and pasted on URI judge. Note that this imply in code repetition between folders since i can't modularize. 

Also, by the nature of URI (all code must be in a single submission) things can get a bit monstrous.
Steadfast and may Dijkstra forgive me.
