# uri_graph
## Mea culpa

I tried to isolate each exercise's code on it's own folder, so it can be just copied and pasted on URI judge. Note that this imply in code repetition between folders since i can't modularize it. 

Also, by the nature of URI (all code must be in a single submission) things can get a bit monstrous. May help to note that all code specific to a question resolution will be on main and before it will just be a graph represatation abstraction (that i downgraded from another assigment LOL)
Steadfast and may Dijkstra forgive me.
